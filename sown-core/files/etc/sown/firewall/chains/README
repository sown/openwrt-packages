# chains should be single executable files with a number as the initial part
# of the file name
#
# chains will be loaded in the order of the filename numbers
#
# the default policy of a built-in chain should be 'accept'
# if you need a default-deny, create a new non-built-in chain and jump all
# traffic to it. 'accept' traffic you like back from your new chain, to the
# built-in chain, and reject anything that reaches the bottom of your new chain
